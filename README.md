# NOT AVAILABLE
This repository is for research purpose, so I'm not maintaining it like a real project.
Instead, I'll give few updates to include endpoints and such implementation for go.

## Objective
Since its for learning purposes, this project will guarantee some rules to achieve the objective of making
an entire Golang Lib such as following project layouts and using all available ways to
communicate with Pterodacyl's API.
